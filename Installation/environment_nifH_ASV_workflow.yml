## This file describes tools required to run the nifH ASV workflow.
## Additionally the tools provided in the environment DADA2_nifH, which was
## created during installation of the DADA2 nifH pipeline, are required.
## Both environments must be activated in order to use the workflow (using
## --stack, described in INSTALL.txt).
##
## Maintainer caution: Do NOT add R packages because we want the R installed in
## DADA2_nifH to be used.  See detailed maintainer note in the DADA2 nifH
## pipeline file Installation/environment_DADA2_nifH.yml.
