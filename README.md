This repository contains all post-pipeline software stages and data deliverables from the workflow described in Morando, Magasin et al. 2023.  The workflow processes nearly all nifH amplicon data sets (MiSeq) that existed at the time of publication.  DADA2 ASVs are created by the pipeline, which has a separate repository.
